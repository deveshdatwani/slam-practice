### We're Slam-ing!  

Slam is exciting. Slam is fun. This repository is my personal practice board to implement classical slam algorithms.

Through this repository, I intend to keep a track of all the papers I read on slam and try to implement them. And if not the entire paper, then important concepts and data structures to store sensor data for practice and fun.
